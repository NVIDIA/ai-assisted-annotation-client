Getting Started
===============

NVIDIA AI-Assisted Annotation SDK follows a client-server approach to integrate into an application.  Once a user has been granted early access user can use either C++ or Python client to integrate the SDK into an existing medical imaging application.

It officially supports following 3 platforms
   - Linux (Ubuntu16+)
   - macOS (High Sierra and above)
   - Windows (Windows 10)


Installing prebuilt C++ packages
--------------------------------
Download the binary packages for corresponding OS supported from `Releases <https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-assisted-annotation-client/releases>`_.


Linux
^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   export version=1.0.1
   wget https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-assisted-annotation-client/releases/download/v${version}/NvidiaAIAAClient-${version}-Linux.sh
   sudo sh NvidiaAIAAClient-${version}-Linux.sh --prefix=/usr/local --exclude_sub_dir --skip-license

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
   c++ -std=c++11 -o example example.cpp -lNvidiaAIAAClient
   ./example


MacOS
^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   export version=1.0.1
   wget https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-assisted-annotation-client/releases/download/v${version}/NvidiaAIAAClient-${version}-Darwin.sh
   sh NvidiaAIAAClient-${version}-Darwin.sh --prefix=/usr/local --exclude_sub_dir --skip-license
   
   c++ -std=c++11 -o example example.cpp -lNvidiaAIAAClient
   ./example


Windows
^^^^^^^
   Download NvidiaAIAAClient-``<version>``-win64.exe from `Releases <https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-assisted-annotation-client/releases>`_ and Install the package.  Say by-default it installs into C:\Program Files\NvidiaAIAAClient

.. code-block:: bash

   PATH=C:\Program Files\NvidiaAIAAClient\bin;%PATH%
   cl /EHsc -I"C:\Program Files\NvidiaAIAAClient\include" example.cpp /link NvidiaAIAAClient.lib /LIBPATH:"C:\Program Files\NvidiaAIAAClient\lib"
   example.exe


Following is the code snippet to start using AIAA Client APIs

.. code-block:: cpp

   // example.cpp
   #include <nvidia/aiaa/client.h>
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
      try {
         // Create AIAA Client object
         nvidia::aiaa::Client client("http://my-aiaa-server.com:5000/v1");
   
         // List all models
         nvidia::aiaa::ModelList modelList = client.models();
         std::cout << "Models Supported by AIAA Server: " << modelList.toJson() << std::endl;
   
         // Get matching model for organ Spleen
         nvidia::aiaa::Model model = modelList.getMatchingModel("spleen");
         std::cout << "Selected AIAA Model for organ 'Spleen' is: " << model.toJson(2) << std::endl;
   
         // More API calls can follow here...
      } catch (nvidia::aiaa::exception& e) {
         std::cerr << "nvidia::aiaa::exception => nvidia.aiaa.error." << e.id << "; description: " << e.name() << std::endl;
      }

      return 0;
   }

More details on C++ Client APIs can be found `client.h
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-assisted-annotation-client/blob/master/src/cpp-client/include/nvidia/aiaa/client.h>`_



CMake Support
-------------
You can also use the NvidiaAIAAClient interface target in CMake. This target populates the appropriate usage requirements for ``NvidiaAIAAClient_INCLUDE_DIRS`` to point to the appropriate include directories and ``NvidiaAIAAClient_LIBRARY`` for linking the necessary Libraries.


Find Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^
To use this library from a CMake project, you can locate it directly with find_package() and use the namespaced imported target from the generated package configuration:

::

   # CMakeLists.txt
   find_package(NvidiaAIAAClient REQUIRED)
   ...
   include_directories(${NvidiaAIAAClient_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   ...
   target_link_libraries(foo ${NvidiaAIAAClient_LIBRARY})


The package configuration file, NvidiaAIAAClientConfig.cmake, can be used either from an install tree or directly out of the build tree.
For example, you can specify the ``-DNvidiaAIAAClient_DIR`` option while generating the CMake targets for project foo::

   $ cmake -DNvidiaAIAAClient_DIR=/user/xyz/myinstall/lib/cmake/NvidiaAIAAClient


External Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can achieve this by adding External Project in CMake.

::

   # CMakeLists.txt
   ...
   ExternalProject_Add(NvidiaAIAAClient
      GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-assisted-annotation-client.git
      GIT_TAG v1.0.1
   )
   ...
   target_link_libraries(foo ${NvidiaAIAAClient_LIBRARY})
