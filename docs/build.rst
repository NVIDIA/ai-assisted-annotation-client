Building C++ Client
-------------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   - `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_ (version >= 3.12.4)
   - For Linux/Mac gcc which supports C++ 11 or higher
   - For Windows `Visual Studio 2017 <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads>`_

External Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   - `ITK <https://itk.org>`_ (version = 4.13..1)
   - `Poco <https://pocoproject.org>`_  (version = 1.9.0)
   - `nlohmann_json <https://github.com/nlohmann/json>`_
   
.. note::
   Above are source only dependencies for CMake project.
   They will get downloaded and built as part of super-build project for AIAA Client.
   
Building Binaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Following the below instructions to get the source code and build the project

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-assisted-annotation-client.git NvidiaAIAAClient
   cd NvidiaAIAAClient
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
   
   # If ITK is installed locally
   export MYINSTALL_DIR=/home/xyz/install
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DITK_DIR=${MYINSTALL_DIR}/lib/cmake/ITK-4.13 ../
   
   # If ITK and Poco are installed locally
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DITK_DIR=${MYINSTALL_DIR}/lib/cmake/ITK-4.13 -DPoco_DIR=${MYINSTALL_DIR}/lib/cmake/Poco ../

To Build binaries/package on Linux/MacOS:
   - make -j6
   - cd NvidiaAIAAClient-Build
   - make `package`

To Build binaries/package on Windows:
   - open ``NvidiaAIAAClient-superbuild.sln`` and run ``ALL_BUILD`` target
   - open ``NvidiaAIAAClient.sln`` under NvidiaAIAAClient-Build and run ``PACKAGE`` target to build *(in Release mode)* an installable-package


.. note::
   - Use Release mode for faster build.
   - For Windows, use CMAKE GUI client to configure and generate the files.  
   - For Windows, if ITK is not externally installed, then use shorter path for *ROOT* Folder e.g. ``C:/NvidiaAIAAClient`` to avoid ``LongPath`` error.

Following are some additional CMake Flags helpful while configuring the project.
   -  ``ITK_DIR`` - use already installed ITK libraries and includes
   -  ``Poco_DIR`` - use already installed Poco libraries and includes
   -  ``AIAA_LOG_DEBUG_ENABLED`` - enable/disable Debug-level Logging (default: 0)
   -  ``AIAA_LOG_INFO_ENABLED`` - enable/disable Info-level Logging (default: 1)


Building the Documentation
--------------------------

The NVIDIA AI-Assisted Annotation Client documentation is found in the docs/ directory and is based
on `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_.  `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.org/>`_ integrated with `Exhale <https://github.com/svenevs/exhale>`_ is 
used for C++ API docuementation.

To build the docs install the required dependencies::

  $ apt-get update
  $ apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends doxygen
  $ pip install --upgrade sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme nbsphinx exhale breathe SimpleITK numpy

Then use Sphinx to build the documentation into the build/html
directory::

  $ cd docs
  $ make clean html
